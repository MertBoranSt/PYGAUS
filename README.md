The pygaus code utilised to efficiently and consistently apply a Gaussian model to the relevant data. The code includes matplotlib (Hunter, 2007), numpy (Harris, 2020), pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/) and lmfit (Newville, 2015) Python libraries. 

The code has been developed in the study (Boran et al. 2025) which is capable of averaging and Gaussian modeling of the targets. This code can be applied to Gaussian modeling across a range of spectral types of the stars.
